                Vee first entered the workforce in July 2022 with a summer job at Tim Hortons.  
                She left the job to focus on her final year of high school. 
                 With Laura starting college, in the fall of 2023, she is now looking for a
                part time job that will allow extra hours during the summer and then return to part time while she attends college.
